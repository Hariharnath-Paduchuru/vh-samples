# VH-Samples

The VH-Samples project contains a set of projects used for both demonstrating and testing VHC functionality. It consists of the following components:

* `vh-remote-logging`: Log to remote syslog server
* `vh-storage-exampe`: Use external storage devices

There are many more projects being added

Each project is similar but should have its own documentation for building and deploying on a Hub.
